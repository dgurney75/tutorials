Adobe Animate CC

An AIR Native Extension (ANE) is a single file with the extension ane. This file contains all of the native and actionscript libraries that are implemented by this extension. You donâ€™t need access to a separate SWC file or to the source code to be able to use the ANE.

Here we will add the extension to your application so you can use the functionality provided by the extension.

In your mobile project you want to add it into, click on the wrench icon next to the actionscript 3 settings dropdown in the properties window.



You will then click on the plus icon under Library path tab to selection a new file to add to your application.

Click on the ANE icon to add the Native Extension by browsing to the where the file exists.

Select the ANE extension file. Once it's added in, you can expand out the details of the extension to see the target platforms supported by the extension. 



The extension is now included in your project.



You should now be able to return to your code and use the functionality and classes supplied in the extension, hopefully you've been supplied with documentation or example usage of the extension.
